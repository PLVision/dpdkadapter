Intel® DPDK is a set of software libraries and Ethernet drivers (native and virtualized) that run in
Linux user space to boost packet processing throughput on Intel® architecture.

DPDKAdapter is a static C++ library that uses DPDK library and provides the following capabilities to an external application through its simple API:
Transmit streams of packets  in a line rate according to a chosen scheme and timing requirements;
Capture Ethernet traffic on a line rate.

Dpdkadapter is used for support Intel® DPDK for Ostinato, with all its functionality preserved.

Why DPDK provides considerable speed improvements
 - Allows avoiding latency while copying through kernel space
 - Allows avoiding using Linux scheduler and bind thread to CPU core
 - No threads synchronization

Ostinato is an open-source, cross-platform network packet crafter/traffic generator and analyzer. Craft and send packets of several streams with different protocols at different rates.

Steps to use Ostinato with DPDK adapter:
1. Download DPDK by link:
   http://dpdk.org/browse/dpdk/tag/?id=v1.7.0

   Put it in main "Ostinato DPDK" folder, folder name should be dpdk-1.7.0.

2. Modify the following dpdk file to compile it properly:
    dpdk-1.7.0/config/common_linuxapp
      CONFIG_RTE_BUILD_SHARED_LIB=y # Compile to share library
      CONFIG_RTE_BUILD_COMBINE_LIBS=y # Combine to one single library

3. Build dpdkadapter:
    cd path/to/ostinato_dpdk_repo/dpdkadapter
    # run script sudo ./custom_setup.sh <interface_list>
    sudo ./custom_setup.sh eth1 eth2
    make

4. Ostinato dependencies should be met on system, for more details please refer Ostinato manual:
    sudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev libpcap-dev mercurial
    

5. Build Ostinato:
    cd path/to/ostinato_dpdk_repo
    qmake
    make

Run Ostinato server uses DPDKAdapter:
    - sudo ./path/to/ostinato_dpdk_repo/start.sh
